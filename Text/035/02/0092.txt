am yesterday follows tomorrow middle am i beginning eternity time space beginning am i glittering downward thrust sparkling spears rust weight my belly trees my nails my ribs feet lack am i am measured am miss me flown am i my life measured hours serve devoured thin am quick fat am slow wind my foe am i lighter i m me hidden seen am i sitting eats hungry third goes returns
